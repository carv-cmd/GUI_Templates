Widgets:
-------------------
Relative to the basic_gui.py example
These are things like buttons, entry fields, labels, and a frame
Others include; checkboxes, tree views, scrollbars, text areas, etc.

Widgets are often referred to as "controls"
* Also sometimes seen referred to as 'Windows' (mainly Tk documentation)
--------------------------------------


-------------------
Widget Classes:
-------------------
Widgets are objects, instances of classes that represent the elements of Tk
So upon creation of a widget the very first thing we do is:
Identify the specific class of the widget that we would like to instantiate
--------------------------------------


-------------------
Widget Hierarchy:
-------------------
Also, to create a widget we must have a parent to associate it with
Widgets need to have a parent 'container', they cant just float off arbitrarily..
In Tk, all widgets are part of a "widget (or window) hierarchy"
At the top the of the hierarchy is the 'root' which all other widgets trace back to
* tree model w/ single root node ~ the window itself

In the basic_gui.py example, consider the 'content frame'
This was a single frame created as a child of the 'root window'
Spawning from that frame were all the other controls (widgets) as children
* The root window was a 'container' for the frame and was, therefore, the frames 'parent'

This hierarchy can be nested arbitrarily deep
Even a new window within the application ('toplevel') is part of that same hierarchy
That window and all its contents form a subtree of the overall widget hierarchy.

Creating Widgets
-------------------
Each separate widget is a Python object.
When instantiating a widget, you must pass its parent as a parameter to the widget class.
The only exception is the "root" window, which is the toplevel window that will contain everything else.
